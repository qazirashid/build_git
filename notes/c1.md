# Commit 01

I think the first commit will be the hardest to understand. If I can digest it then later commits should become easier. Let's give it a go. 

Let's copy across the files in the first commit from the git repo to src directory in this repo, and commit it to this repo.

There are a few things I could do to start. I could start with the 'README' that Linus wrote for the first commit. Or I could start building to see if I can build the first commit. Or I could jump in and start reading the code. 

I guess we can start noting an observation and then skim the 'README'.

## Early Observations 
1- There are 8 .c files that Linus wrote. He did not start one huge .c file to begin with. 
2- Looking at the Makefile, Linus builds 6 executable files from the source files. This again seem rather large number of programs for the first commit. 
3- The 6 programs are 'update-cache', 'show-diff', 'write-tree', 'read-tree', 'commit-tree' and 'cat-file'. Looks like these are component programs that will be glued together at some later stage. 
4- the build target 'init-db' has a dependency 'init-db.o' but no rule for building it. I think Linus will initialise the db (don't know what that is) mannually. That is a bit of problem because I won't know what he did because it won't be caputred in the history. 
5- The Makefile has a 'backup' target that depends on 'clean'. It requires cleaning up the repo and then runing tar on a directory named 'dir-cache' to generate a compressed archive.
